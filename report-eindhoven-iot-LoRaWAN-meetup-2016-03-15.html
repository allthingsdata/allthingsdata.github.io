<h1>LoRaWAN IoT Meetup of 14 March 2016 of the Eindhoven IoT Meetup</h1>

<p>Short, crude report of the Meetup by Peter Vandenabeele of <a href="/">All Things Data</a>.

<h2>Hackaton Arduino, Rasberry Pie, LoRaWAN boards</h2>
<p>From 17:00 to 19:00 people where having fun with boards and LoRaWAN set-ups.</p>

<h2>Introduction by Lorna Goulden</h2>

<p>Lorna explained a number of introductory aspects of LoRaWAN:</p>

<p>What are the apps for LoRaWAN and IoT in Smart Cities ?</p>
<ul>
  <li>waste management</li>
  <li>parking sensors</li>
  <li>radio-activity sensors</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>What is LoRaWAN ?</p>
<ul>
  <li>not for phone/video's ... (limited bandwidth, only 30 seconds per day)</li>
  <li>range up to 10 km, much less in practice ...</li>
  <li>different classes: A B C (see <a href="http://www.lora-alliance.org" target="_blank">www.lora-alliance.org</a> for details)</li>
</ul>

<p>Typical LoRa IoT Network Solution:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/lora-iot-network-solution-0001.png" alt="lora iot network solution shows end nodes pet tracking smoke alarm water heater trash container vending machine gas monitoring gateways network server application servers"></img></p>

<p>An import player in this field is <a href="http://thethingsnetwork.org/" target="_blank">The Things Network</a> that started out of Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Lorna showed some prototype electronics, which was detailed later by other speakers.</p>

<p>A key question is "What can you do with it" ? The image below formulates these questions:<p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/transform-IoT-technology-to-useful-apps-0001.png"></img></p>

<p>An interesting note is that LoRaWAN is not the only technology ... Lorna showed this list at eejournal.com of Low Power Networks. Also later speakers mentioned that the optimal network technology is dependent on the application (public/private site, Saas or private model, one- or two-directional, ...). The original table is referenced from this <a href="http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20150907-lpwa/" target="_blank">article in eejournal</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.eejournal.com/files/7314/4236/1647/Table_-_large_130_v3.png" alt="table with LPWAN technologies"></img></p>

<p>Introducing the next speakers, again raised the question: "All fine, but ... what can you do with it ??"</p>

<h2>Speaker 1: Dennis Tilgencamp (Storm Company) Starting up a biz in IoT</h2>

<p>Dennis introduced Storm company with this slide:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/storm-company-0001.png" alt="Storm Company"></img>

<p>Dennis explained the current status as a "lean" company, only contractors and partners.</p>

<p>He also explained how he sees IoT as a market and that the rapid rise of LoRaWAN was the trigger
that pushed him to start it "this is it ...".</p>

<p>Criteria for LoRa are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>public (kpn + Belgacom) vs Private (own gateway on-site) vs Crowd (The Things Network etc.)</li>
  <li>What is the required critical mass ? Will it reach it ? =&gt; LoRa gained a lot traction</li>
  <li>Many other technologies: 2/3/4/5G, Narrowband IoT, Zigbee, BLE, ...</li>
</ul>

<p>Dennis showed this architecture from Loriot.io (A LoRa service provider) (image taken from <a href="http://loriot.io" target="_blank">loriot.io</a>).</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/loriot-infrastructure-iot-0001.png" alt="Loriot.io architecture for infrastructure for IoT"></img></p>

<p>Dennis showed how kpn is speeding up their LoRaWAN coverage and gave some info on pricing
plans from kpn and Loriot.io (I failed to take note of the exact numbers).</p>

<p>Business opportunities seen by Dennis, see image below</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/iot-business-opportunities-0001.png" alt="iot business opportunities asse tracking state monitoring fill level smart parking"></img></p>

<p>A particular opportunity exists for industrial sites where, despite the global network, people still want a private network on the site.</p>

<p>Also, the choice of hardware is not a given at all ... everything is still to be chosen.</p>

<p>Dennis gave some examples of first commercial projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fill level of oil tanks in Switserland (but I see cables attached ?)</li>
  <li>AED (temperature, cannot be too low; when is it used ?)</li>
  <li>Elderly care application (much lower power, less battery replacement)</li>
  <li>Parking sensor</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the relevant features for a sensor? See the image below:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/features-iot-sensor-0001.png" alt="features of a sensor, see list below"></img></p>

<ul>
  <li>triangulation to avoid the GPS battery drain</li>
  <li>level, movement, ...</li>
  <li>battery status</li>
  <li>full - empty sensors</li>
  <li>temperature</li>
  <li>panic button</li>
</ul>

<p>Commercial next steps for Storm Company that Dennis showed are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Concept design (find a design company for visualisation)</li>
  <li>Partner with hardware engineering company</li>
  <li>Prototype</li>
  <li>Validate</li>
  <li>Fund?</li>
  <li>service offerings in parallel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Speaker 2: Jeroen Blok and Marco Rudolph</h2>

<p>Jeroen and Marco showed a lot of hardware that they had built, bought and looked
at. This is an overview of the different LoRa Gateways:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/lora-gateways-0001.png" alt="lora gateways"></img></p>

<p>These are some DIY Node Sensors they built:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/lora-node-sensors-0001.png" alt="lora node sensors"></img></p>

<p>The nodes are based oni SODAQ nodes, Arduino, Raspberry pi + LoRaWAN radio (often
from Microchip)</p>

<p>The GateWays shown are mainly from Kerlink, Lorank 8, the crowd sourced GW from
The Things Network (available in June 2016). In order not to have to wait for the
TTN Gateway, they started building their own gateways, mainly based on Rapsberry
Pi + LoRa module for radio, see picture below:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/raspberry-pi-lorawan-module-0001.png" alt="Raspberry Pi LoRaWan module"></img></p>

<p>A board with a Microchip module is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/microchip-lorawan-module-0001.png" alt="microchip lorawan module"></img></p>

<p>Then they continued to show the current coverage of Eindhoven with LoRaWAN gateways:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/eindhoven-lorawan-gateway-coverage-0001.png" alt="eindhoven lorawan gateway coverage"></img></p>

<p>Fun thing to note is that some of the Gateways in Eindhoven are from people who meet at
<a href="https://madspace.nl/the-eindhoven-hackerspace/" target="_blank">MADspace Eindhoven</a> on Wednesday evenings.</p>

<p>Gateways that are set-up can send to The Things Network, but they can _also_ send to other
network, e.g. the SemTech network, see image below:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/eindhoven-semtech-lorawan-coverage-0001.png" alt="eindhoven semtech lorawan coverage"></img></p>

<p>Jeroen showed the original network architecture of the TTN and showed some sample messages</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/initial-network-architecture-TTN-0001.png" alt="initial network architecture TTN"></img></p>

<h2>Speaker 3: Rene Schouwman from Inteliments</h2>

<p>Rene showed this overview of the ecosystem in which he is working:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/inteliments-ecosystem-0001.png" alt="initeliments ecosystem"></img></p>

<p>An example of an application he is selling is SOLARTHERM which measures the savings
in gas that are realised with sun heating of the boiler</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/intelliments-solartherm-0001.png" alt="initeliments solartherm"></img></p>

<p>Another small demo application is indoor air quality (CO2, temp, humidity) and use that
to drive the air conditioning (it was a very crude solution because the sensors where
not very accurate in this version):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/indoor-air-quality-0001.png" alt="indoor air quality"></img></p>

<p>Technologies used in the different solutions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MQTT</li>
  <li>LoraWAN</li>
  <li>SigFox (very useful for static objects (e.g. crop field, humity)</li>
  <li>IQRF MESH Network  (for customers with very private data, not "in the cloud")</li>
</ul>


<p>Security is becoming very important now ... Next to this, Inteliments also offers
an IoT platform (IntelliGlue), Integrated connectivity to analytics and consulting.</p>

<p>An interesting note is that SigFOX stores the data in the cloud and you can ask it
back via API. Also SigFOX has a "long" tranmission time. More applications discussed
where Asset tracking (with GPS) of bulldozers, waste management of glass containers.</p>
